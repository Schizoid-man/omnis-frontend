This is an End-to-end encrypted chat app built with Expo + React Native. This repo contains the mobile client, local storage, and crypto utilities.

## Features

- End-to-end encryption (AES-GCM + ECDH P-384)

## Requirements

- Node.js 20+
- Docker (for containerized Android builds)

## Quick start (dev)

```bash
npm install
npx expo start
```

## Android release build (local)

We build Android inside Docker and ignore the generated android/ folder in git.

```bash
docker compose build
docker compose up -d android
docker compose exec android npx expo prebuild --platform android --non-interactive
docker compose exec android npm install
docker compose exec android bash -c "cd android && ./gradlew assembleRelease"
```

APK output:

## CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

The workflow builds the APK on every push to main (or manual run) and uploads it as an artifact.
